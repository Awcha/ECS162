# Restaurant Tinder

## Things to notice

The README is written after the deadline.

In style.css, the #right can change to:  
#right {  
margin-top: 10%;  
margin-bottom: 10%;  
margin-right: 20%;  
background:white;  
width: 30%;  
}  
so that it looks nicer.

After the deadline, there is a problem that the page cannot go to the next step, we added one blank line and two console.log() in server.js to see
what happened, and the problem was solved with no reason after adding the blank line and two console.log(), then we removed the the blank line and 
two console.log(), and the problem never occured again. So, all files now are the same as those before the deadline, except this README.

Note: If this problem occur again(the client pages don't change and says "waiting..."), try to remove line 35,36,50,51 of client.js.
